# Sensory Monitoring Bracelet for Autistic Children

## Overview
The Sensory Monitoring Bracelet is a wearable device designed to monitor time and detect sensory information, including anxiety, stress, and movement. It is specifically designed to help parents and caregivers track the emotional and physical reactions of autistic children. This bracelet helps identify when a child may be experiencing heightened stress or anxiety, allowing for timely interventions.

## Features
- **Timekeeping**: Displays the current time on the bracelet.
- **Sensor Monitoring**: Equipped with multiple sensors (e.g., MAX30100, accelerometer, microphone) to detect various sensory inputs.
- **Anxiety and Stress Detection**: Monitors heart rate, movement patterns, and environmental sounds to detect potential signs of anxiety or agitation.
- **Bluetooth Connectivity**: Sends real-time sensory data to an app for further analysis and monitoring.

## App Integration
The Sensory Monitoring Bracelet is designed to work in conjunction with a dedicated mobile app that is currently in development. The app will:
- Receive real-time sensory data from the bracelet.
- Display the child’s anxiety and stress levels.
- Provide feedback and suggestions for interventions based on the detected data.

## Purpose
The primary goal of the bracelet is to assist parents, caregivers, and educators in understanding and monitoring the emotional and sensory responses of autistic children. By tracking key metrics such as heart rate, movement, and environmental noise, the bracelet can help identify moments of stress or anxiety, providing valuable insights into the child’s well-being.

## Installation
To use the Sensory Monitoring Bracelet:
1. Download the accompanying mobile app (currently under development).
2. Pair the bracelet with your mobile device via Bluetooth.
3. Monitor the real-time data and receive notifications regarding the child's emotional state.

## Components
- **Arduino-based Microcontroller**: Powers the bracelet and manages sensor data.
- **MAX30100 Pulse Oximeter and Heart Rate Sensor**: Monitors the child's heart rate.
- **Accelerometer**: Detects movement patterns to assess agitation or physical activity.
- **Microphone**: Measures environmental noise levels to gauge stress or anxiety.
- **Bluetooth Module**: Sends data to the mobile app for analysis.

## Future Developments
- **Mobile App**: An app to be developed to receive and visualize data from the bracelet.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Future versions may include machine learning algorithms to predict anxiety or stress events based on historical data.
- **Customization**: The bracelet will offer customizable sensitivity levels for different sensory triggers.
